# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains notes, resources, and examples related to **Requirement Analysis**‚Äîan essential phase in software development. 

Requirement analysis helps identify **what a system should do**, gather stakeholder expectations, define system boundaries, and ensure the final product aligns with user needs. This repository will serve as a reference and documentation hub for exploring this critical process.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified product. It involves understanding **what the users require** from a system and ensuring those needs are clearly documented and agreed upon before development begins.

### üîç Key Activities Include:
- **Eliciting requirements** from stakeholders (through interviews, surveys, observation, etc.)
- **Analyzing and refining** those requirements
- **Documenting** the requirements in a structured form (such as SRS ‚Äì Software Requirements Specification)
- **Validating and verifying** that requirements are clear, complete, and feasible

### üìå Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):
1. **Foundation for Development:** Acts as the blueprint for design, development, and testing.
2. **Reduces Errors and Rework:** Clear requirements help avoid misunderstandings and costly changes later in the project.
3. **Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Ensures that the final product meets the actual needs of users and clients.
4. **Improves Planning:** Enables more accurate estimation of time, cost, and resources.
5. **Supports Quality Assurance:** Provides a basis for creating test cases and validating that the system meets its goals.

Without proper requirement analysis, a project risks failure due to poor understanding of what needs to be built. It is often said: **"Building the wrong system perfectly is still a failure."** That‚Äôs why this phase is critical in any successful software development effort.
