# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains notes, resources, and examples related to **Requirement Analysis**‚Äîan essential phase in software development. 

Requirement analysis helps identify **what a system should do**, gather stakeholder expectations, define system boundaries, and ensure the final product aligns with user needs. This repository will serve as a reference and documentation hub for exploring this critical process.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified product. It involves understanding **what the users require** from a system and ensuring those needs are clearly documented and agreed upon before development begins.

### üîç Key Activities Include:
- **Eliciting requirements** from stakeholders (through interviews, surveys, observation, etc.)
- **Analyzing and refining** those requirements
- **Documenting** the requirements in a structured form (such as SRS ‚Äì Software Requirements Specification)
- **Validating and verifying** that requirements are clear, complete, and feasible

### üìå Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):
1. **Foundation for Development:** Acts as the blueprint for design, development, and testing.
2. **Reduces Errors and Rework:** Clear requirements help avoid misunderstandings and costly changes later in the project.
3. **Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Ensures that the final product meets the actual needs of users and clients.
4. **Improves Planning:** Enables more accurate estimation of time, cost, and resources.
5. **Supports Quality Assurance:** Provides a basis for creating test cases and validating that the system meets its goals.

Without proper requirement analysis, a project risks failure due to poor understanding of what needs to be built. It is often said: **"Building the wrong system perfectly is still a failure."** That‚Äôs why this phase is critical in any successful software development effort.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a pivotal role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here are three key reasons why it is essential:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Misunderstandings
Clearly defined requirements ensure that all stakeholders‚Äîincluding clients, developers, testers, and designers‚Äîshare a mutual understanding of the system's goals. This alignment minimizes the risk of misinterpretation and keeps everyone on the same page.

### 2. Saves Time and Cost
Identifying and correcting requirement-related issues during the early stages is far less expensive than fixing them later in the development or post-deployment phases. Requirement analysis helps avoid unnecessary rework, reduces project delays, and ensures optimal use of resources.

### 3. Improves Product Quality and User Satisfaction
Accurate and complete requirements lead to the development of software that meets user expectations and business needs. This enhances customer satisfaction and results in a product that is both functional and valuable.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities to ensure that the system meets the needs of stakeholders. Below are five key activities commonly performed during this phase:

- **Requirement Gathering**
  - This is the initial step where raw requirements are collected from stakeholders, customers, and end users.
  - It focuses on identifying high-level business needs and objectives.

- **Requirement Elicitation**
  - Involves using techniques like interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and observation to extract detailed requirements.
  - It bridges the communication gap between stakeholders and technical teams.

- **Requirement Documentation**
  - All gathered and elicited requirements are recorded in formal documents such as the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
  - Clear documentation ensures traceability and acts as a reference throughout the project lifecycle.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - The collected requirements are analyzed for completeness, consistency, feasibility, and priority.
  - Models such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), or UML are often created to visualize the system.

- **Requirement Validation**
  - Ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are realistic, testable, and unambiguous.
  - This often involves walkthroughs, reviews, and stakeholder approval.
## Types of Requirements

Understanding the different types of requirements is critical to building a reliable and scalable hotel booking system. These requirements are typically classified into **Functional** and **Non-functional** categories.

---

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**. They define the behavior of the system based on user interactions and business needs.

#### Examples from the Booking Management Project:

- **Hotel Management Service:**
  - Hotel managers can log in to a separate portal to manage hotel data.
  - Managers can update hotel details like room availability, pricing, photos, and amenities.
  - The system should sync updates to the master database and reflect changes in real-time.

- **Customer Service (Search + Booking):**
  - Users can search for hotels by date, location, and preferences.
  - Users can make bookings through a booking interface.
  - Customers can cancel or reschedule bookings.
  - The system should interact with a payment gateway for completing bookings.

- **View Booking Service:**
  - Users (both customers and managers) can view current and past bookings.
  - The system should retrieve recent booking data from Redis cache and archive data from Cassandra.

---

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should behave**. These include performance, reliability, scalability, and usability characteristics.

#### Examples from the Booking Management Project:

- **Performance:**
  - The system must support high traffic and concurrent user access using load balancers and server clusters.
  - Page load time should be optimized (e.g., using Redis for caching and ElasticSearch for fast querying).

- **Scalability & Availability:**
  - The application should follow a microservices architecture to scale individual components independently.
  - Services like Kafka and Cassandra should be used to handle high throughput and data archival.

- **Security:**
  - Secure login for both hotel managers and customers.
  - Payment service must integrate securely with third-party payment gateways.

- **Reliability & Data Consistency:**
  - Use of master-slave DB replication ensures consistent and reliable data access.
  - Changes must be reliably propagated to consumers via a messaging queue (Kafka).

- **User Experience:**
  - The system should provide a seamless user experience through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast data loading.
  - The booking interface must be mobile-friendly and responsive.
